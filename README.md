🚀 Exploring Retail Data with Python and pandas!📊

I recently worked on analyzing a retail dataset using Python's pandas library, and I’m excited to share my insights and code with you!

🔍 About the Dataset:
Dataset: Retail sales data (contains customers(male-female) , transactions id's , product details, and revenue) 📈
Size: 999+ rows and 9 columns🛒
Goal: To extract insights into customers behavior, sales trends, and products performance 🤝

🛠️ What I Used:
Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation
Data visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
Insights driven by exploratory data analysis (EDA)

This project helped me explore real-world data challenges, such as handling missing values, reshaping datasets, and visualizing trends. It's been a rewarding experience sharpening my pandas and Python skills.
